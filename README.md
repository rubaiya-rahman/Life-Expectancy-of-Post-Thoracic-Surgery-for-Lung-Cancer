# Life-Expectancy-of-Post-Thoracic-Surgery-for-Lung-Cancer
Day by day the percentage of lung cancer patients
are increasing. So, the percentage of thoracic surgery is also
growing continuously. But the matter of sorrow is, a very few
people stays alive after their surgery. Some of them have more
critical diseases along with lung cancer or some patient’s body
might not bear the load of this surgery and dies. In most of the
cases it leaves an adverse effect on the families of the patients
and also in the career of physicians. Families sometimes spend all
their savings to save the life of their closed ones but after death,
all they are left with zero savings. That’s why this project will
help them to meet the reality and let them know the possibility
of post-surgical survival of the patient based on patients previous
health reports. This approach is to apply logistic regression and
random forest classifier over the data-set and to evaluate the
performance of the classifications to predict the post-operative
survival of the patient
